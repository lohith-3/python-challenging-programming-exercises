# Question 49

# Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.

# Hints
# To override a method in super class, we can define a method with the same name in the super class.

class Shape():
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def area(self):
        return 0


class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length=0):
        Shape.__init__(self)
        self.length = length

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.length


square = Square(5)
print(square.area())
print(Square().area())
